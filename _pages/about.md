I am a [Stanford Institute of Theoretical Physics](https://sitp.stanford.edu/) postdoctoral fellow, working independently in the [Department of Applied Physics](https://appliedphysics.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I use ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and the theory of disordered systems to understand the properties of neural networks and analog computing devices.

I obtained my PhD on July 2024, working in the [Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes](https://msc.u-paris.fr/en/home/) at [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), under the supervision of [Frédéric van Wijland](https://sites.google.com/site/fvanwijland/home?authuser=0). I investigated how and to what extent ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics can be leveraged to speed up sampling in glassy and amorphous systems. My thesis can be found [here](/files/Ghimenti_manuscript.pdf).
